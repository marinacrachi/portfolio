<p align="justify">The first thing I think you should know is that I’m addicted to traveling - Hmm, I never met 
someone who don’t like to travel actually. I can’t say I traveled a lot because, you know… It can 
be quite expensive sometimes. Because of that, everytime I travel I try to make a good planning 
- my friends say that I have a monograph of each place I’ve been lol. Guess this makes me a 
good strategic planner?</p>


<p align="justify">Also, I’m a games lover - back when I was 5, my dream job was to be a game tester for 
Nintendo! I’m not saying that I’m a heavy-platinum-master-expert-gamer, but I really love 
everything that involves a game: The graphics, gameplay, level design, soundtracks (oh, I LOVE 
soundtracks)... By the way, I’m a Pump it Up player too, and I’ve been playing since 2003! PIU 
is a rhythm game, ​<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FPrco9fxIo" target="_blank">you can watch me playing here :D</a></p> 
<p align="justify">Last but not least, I love to cook (and eat, of course)! I really enjoy all the process of studying, 
buying and making food ❤ But I’m not gonna lie, I love restaurants too :p</p>
